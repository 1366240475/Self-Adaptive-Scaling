abstract = {Self-adaptation provides a principled way to deal with software systems' uncertainty during operation. Examples of such uncertainties are disturbances in the environment, variations in sensor readings, and changes in user requirements. As more systems with strict goals require self-adaptation, the need for formal guarantees in self-adaptive systems is becoming a high-priority concern. Designing self-adaptive software using principles from control theory has been identified as one of the approaches to provide guarantees. In general, self-adaptation covers a wide range of approaches to maintain system requirements under uncertainty, ranging from dynamic adaptation of system parameters to runtime architectural reconfiguration. Existing control-theoretic approaches have mainly focused on handling requirements in the form of setpoint values or as quantities to be optimized. Furthermore, existing research primarily focuses on handling uncertainty in the execution environment. This article presents SimCA*, which provides two contributions to the state-of-the-art in control-theoretic adaptation: (i) it supports requirements that keep a value above and below a required threshold, in addition to setpoint and optimization requirements; and (ii) it deals with uncertainty in system parameters, component interactions, system requirements, in addition to uncertainty in the environment. SimCA* provides guarantees for the three types of requirements of the system that is subject to different types of uncertainties. We evaluate SimCA* for two systems with strict requirements from different domains: an Unmanned Underwater Vehicle system used for oceanic surveillance and an Internet of Things application for monitoring a geographical area. The test results confirm that SimCA* can satisfy the three types of requirements in the presence of different types of uncertainty.},

abstract = {The large number of possible configurations of modern software-based systems, combined with the large number of possible environmental situations of such systems, prohibits enumerating all adaptation options at design time and necessitates planning at run time to dynamically identify an appropriate configuration for a situation. While numerous planning techniques exist, they typically assume a detailed state-based model of the system and that the situations that warrant adaptations are known. Both of these assumptions can be violated in complex, real-world systems. As a result, adaptation planning must rely on simple models that capture what can be changed (input parameters) and observed in the system and environment (output and context parameters). We therefore propose planning as optimization: the use of optimization strategies to discover optimal system configurations at runtime for each distinct situation that is also dynamically identified at runtime. We apply our approach to CrowdNav, an open-source traffic routing system with the characteristics of a real-world system. We identify situations via clustering and conduct an empirical study that compares Bayesian optimization and two types of evolutionary optimization (NSGA-II and novelty search) in CrowdNav.},

abstract = {Designing software systems that have to deal with dynamic operating conditions, such as changing availability of resources and faults that are difficult to predict, is complex. A promising approach to handle such dynamics is self-adaptation that can be realized by a MAPE-K feedback loop (Monitor-Analyze-Plan-Execute plus Knowledge). To provide evidence that the system goals are satisfied, given the changing conditions, the state of the art advocates the use of formal methods. However, little research has been done on consolidating design knowledge of self-adaptive systems. To support designers, this paper contributes with a set of formally specified MAPE-K templates that encode design expertise for a family of self-adaptive systems. The templates comprise: (1) behavior specification templates for modeling the different components of a MAPE-K feedback loop (based on networks of timed automata), and (2) property specification templates that support verification of the correctness of the adaptation behaviors (based on timed computation tree logic). To demonstrate the reusability of the formal templates, we performed four case studies in which final-year Masters students used the templates to design different self-adaptive systems.},
